General idea:
- [x] Start by setting players (count and levels)
- [x] That then establishes bins to be filled on the left 
- [x] There are a bunch of buttons on the right, to add monsters of whatever CR
- [ ] As you add monsters it fills bins according to Xanathar's.
- [ ] A low CR monster you might need to add many to gradually fill a row (a player)
- [ ] A high CR monster might immediately fill multiple rows (players)
- [ ] Adding too many will overflow to the n+1th row
- [ ] Can also calculate difficulty according to exp thresholds in DMG
- [ ] For convenience, spit out a dndbeyond link that searches their monster database for monsters of the given CR range
- [ ] Also have a checkbox to limit the search to the 3 core + 3 expansion books
